# Implementation status against Draft 3

Status date: 2026-09-03. This is a development-complete v1 reference implementation, not a production or hostile-code security approval. Current priority, sequencing, and milestone status are governed by the [authoritative roadmap](roadmap.md); this document is an evidence snapshot.

## AVO-004.7 C4/C5 status

C4 coordinator and recovery is complete at code HEAD
`82ace056cf9f0453b43c71845179c437914a041b`, with Terra approval. See the [durable C4
result](avo-0047-c4-result.md). The offline acceptance matrix passed 358 tests with 0 failures;
Ruff, scoped production Pyright, schema parity, and roadmap validation passed. This does not
establish hosted/live readiness or complete AVO-004.7. C5 main rollback authority is complete
for offline acceptance at HEAD `e38d0b826f94f3f559fb2e3ef0b26d1d17128c53`, with Terra APPROVE
and combined 24 passed; see the [C5 result](avo-0047-c5-result.md). C6 campaign runner and
eligibility ledger and C7 are complete offline. C8 remains in progress: the dedicated writer App,
main rulesets, rollback namespace rule, and initial hosted denial probes are now provisioned, while
candidate verifier remediation `5e02ea1`, the durable live controller composition, and the hosted
rollback drill remain. Hosted `main` mutation remains unauthorized; no main/deploy mutation
occurred.

GitHub REST ref deletion has no expected-SHA CAS. The `avo/main-rollback/*` namespace now has an
exclusive writer-App ruleset, but rollback cleanup must still close only after exact-ref
authoritative post-state observation and the fresh protected drill.

## Roadmap coverage

| Phase | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — contracts | Complete | Strict versioned Pydantic records, 49 checked-in schemas, RFC 8785 hashing, closed transition tables, dependency/threat records, CLI diagnostics, Linux/Windows CI. |
| 1 — local vertical slice | Complete | SQLite/Alembic ledger, outbox, leases, budgets, filesystem CAS, deny-first policy, recorded harness, API/CLI lifecycle, crash recovery. |
| 2 — evaluator integrity | Complete for the declared trusted-team boundary | Digest-pinned, tier-separated Docker images; reproducible native/WSL manifests; hardened runtime; hidden-read, host-write, egress, malformed-report, archive, path, Unicode, and collision tests. |
| 3 — agentic variation | Complete for the bounded reference defect | Native structured harness, HTTPS model gateway, capability tokens, tool broker, private attempts, frozen candidate, single lineage, admission CAS, provenance, and deterministic supervisor. |
| Bounded structured inference | Implemented, experimental; live canary and offline evidence gate passed | Generic strict-JSON input/output boundary, exact raw wire validation, source/wire schema digests, OpenRouter routing defaults, invocation provenance, and advisory patch-review contracts are present. The first one-call/no-retry Luna review passed its preregistered schema, semantic, provenance, and quality gates. A frozen ten-case offline corpus now covers four substantive categories plus malformed, refusal, truncation, omitted-field, fabricated-evidence, and insufficient-evidence boundaries with deterministic scoring and content-addressed reports. Repeated live model evidence remains outstanding. |
| 4 — production hardening | Selectively implemented | Authenticated mutation API, strong revision ETags, two-person role-gated review, retention tombstones, RO-Crate and SLSA exports are present. Production adapters and isolation remain gated below. |
| 5 — alternatives | Experimental contract implementations | Hybrid archive and population strategies exist behind the equal-budget/ADR gate, plus signed plugin compatibility checks. They are not the v1 default and make no superiority claim. |
| Coding-agent integration | First full recursive admission and replay-proven terminal hardening complete | Generic async runtime lifecycle, recorded contract adapter, SDK 0.147.0 plus signed/absolute CLI 0.149.1, exact ChatGPT Pro identity, strict schema and permission digests, isolated home/tmp, live boundary canaries, VCS/config-free workspaces, normalized evidence, cancellation, reconciliation, economics, and provenance are implemented. The frozen comparison admitted 8/8 Codex and 6/8 native candidates. The first Luna AVO-on-AVO attempt was correctly rejected at 277,350/200,000 input tokens; deterministic replay of all 578 retained events proves the corrected terminal path with no provider contact or reconciliation. A second one-turn Luna campaign used 197,800/350,000 input tokens, passed Ruff, strict Pyright, 176 tests, and the frozen private evaluator, reconstructed exactly, verified provenance, and admitted the two-file candidate as the run champion. The real workspace remains unchanged pending explicit human review. |

| Control-plane-only evaluator credential | `tests/security/test_evaluator_socket.py` |

The full suite enforces 85% branch-aware coverage, strict Pyright, Ruff, schema regeneration parity, tier-image execution, and exact frozen dependencies. The detailed live evidence is recorded in `docs/codex-live-gate.md`.

## Deliberately gated production work

The packet says Phase 4 adapters are delivered only when their promotion criteria are met. A single-host greenfield reference workload does not justify PostgreSQL, S3/MinIO, OPA, Temporal/DBOS, OpenTelemetry infrastructure, or a second worker. Standard Docker is also explicitly not represented as hostile-code containment. Those additions remain blocked until the corresponding load, multi-host, independent-policy, observability, or security-review trigger occurs.

Accordingly, backup/restore drills, PostgreSQL/S3 transaction parity, centralized signed Rego distribution, and gVisor/Kata/VM-worker approval are release blockers for any future production claim—not missing prerequisites for this declared local trusted-team v1 boundary. The sanitized recursive capstone is complete; autonomous source promotion remains experimental pending AVO-004 in the [authoritative roadmap](roadmap.md).
